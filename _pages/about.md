**Welcome to my page!!!**

I am a final-year PhD student in the department of Astrophysics at the University of Chicago, advised by Alex Drlica-Wagner.


My research blends astrophysics with data science.


I am a member of the Survey Science group at the university of Chicago, the Dark Energy Survey, while I also co-lead the deep learning education club hosted by the Deep Skies Lab. I have been recently named a Rising Star in Data Science by the Center for Data and Computing, UChicago. 


I am originially from the beautiful island of Crete, Greece, where I spent the first 25 years of my life, having a lot of fun and getting degrees (BSc & MS) in Physics.
In my free time, I like fl√¢neuring around Chicago, biking by the lake Michigan, or being involved in activities at the International House at the University of Chicago, of which I am a non-residential fellow.
